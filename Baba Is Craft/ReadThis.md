# How to use:
1. Download the entire avatar
2. Put into your Figura Avatars folder
3. Choose a character within action menu, since you have to do that on first load up.

This avatar is mildly buggy, but if you have anything to mention to me, please tell me!
Also, use my code from this avatar! It took me a while but I think that people like using this code, since of how simple it is!


Thanks to Katt for making the Dynamic Crosshair code, to Slyme for making Patpat, and thank you to all of the lovely people in the hellp channel helping me code this avatar!
